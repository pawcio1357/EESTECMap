To use, you need the following tools:
- Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) - http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries
- Node.js - http://nodejs.org/download/
- TopoJSON - after installing Node.js in the terminal type 
	npm install -g topojson
- Make



The up-to-date geodata is downloaded from Natural Earth, unzipped and processed to produce an easily adjustable EESTEC map.

To edit the countries highlighted as those with EESTEC LCs edit the COUNTRIES variable in Makefile - you have to use country codes from ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3).

To edit the cities with LCs edit the CITIES variable in Makefile.

EESTEC countries which are outside Europe should be added to the OUT-EUROPE variable in Makefile.

The style of the EESTEC countries highlight can be edited in the $(COUNTRIES) rule in Makefile(this will later be included in style/eestec.css).
All the other styles can be edited in the file style/map.css





To generate the map, in the root folder type:
	make
The map will then be available in map.html in the root folder.

You can preview the map here: http://student.agh.edu.pl/~pmaslak/EESTECMap/map.html
